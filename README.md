## Track Chat

This is a simple chat room application.  Users can sign up when visiting the page and their name will be displayed when they send messages.  

I made this so that members of my band and I can discuss tracks we are working on in an easy clean setting.  

## Tools

This Single Page Application (SPA) was built using the AngularJS framework. Together with FireBase NoSQL DB and AngularFire, Track Chat commits your messages to the backend and returns a promise in real time with two way data binding. This simple, yet elegant application could be a standalone tool or integrated into a larger project for communication purposes.
